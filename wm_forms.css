/* Field Set Styles */
/* Below, I have created one for the fieldsets and another for the legends within the fieldsets. The first style gets rid of the border around the fieldsets; gives it a width of 60% of the form; and a margin of 10px on the top and bottom sides. The second style affects the legend within the fieldset and changes its background color to a pinkish hue; gives it a width of 100% of the fieldsets; and adds a 2px margin to the top and bottom sides. */

The first style changes the look of all label elements and makes it so that they float left when the left margin is cleared, displays them as blocks meaning that the label elements will be on their own line. I also gave them a width of 40% and a margin of 2px on the bottom and top sides.*/
